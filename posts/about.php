	<p id="aboutContent">Jordan Taffet has emerged himself in the medium of photography since the age of 15, when he used a small point-and-shoot to document his journey across the United States as a part of the social-political teen tour "Etgar 36."  Through a surprising (at least, for him) amount of dedication, Jordan has since expanded his photography from the purely documentary towards photos of all varieties.  Not wanting to corner himself within a specific genre, Jordan has made sure to experiment within a wide variety of photographic fields, such as nature, street, architectural, still-life, abstract, and portraiture photography through both color and B&W mediums.  He currently attends the Friends' Central School in Philadelphia, where he continues to pursue his passion of photography.</p>
